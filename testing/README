The files in this directory show how to build naive Bayes models
independent of the general FCP framework. This can be useful if
you are interested in only a specific set of genomes. Although
designed for use with bacterial and archaeal genomes available at
NCBI, the software can be applied to any genomes of interest.

You can train these example models with:
nb-train -n 10 -s sequences.txt -m ./models/

A model is build for each FASTA file specified in the sequences.txt 
file (genome1.fna and genome2.fna in this example). A FASTA files 
such as genome1.fna may consists of multiple sequences. 

The above command results in two models being placed in the models folder:
genome1.txt
genome2.txt

You can classify the sequences in query.fna using:
nb-classify -q query.fna -m models.txt -r nb_results.txt

The model.txt file simply provides a list of models to consider.
